# Instructions for setting up and running frontend 

1. Install nvm, use instructions from https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating
2. Install node and npm (installing node should automatically install npm I think)
3. cd to the Frontend directory
4. To start the local server with React, run:
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
You should get this series of lines:
  VITE v5.1.x  ready in xxx ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
  ➜  press h + enter to show help

Click on the link to open the website in your browser. (the port may be different, but Vite is usually 5173)
